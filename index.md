Hi there! I am Weiyan Wang(王伟俨), a PhD candidate from Computer Science and Engineering Department, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Currently, I am researching on the **co-design of both system and algorithm** for large scale machine learning system . By exploring the large design space combining system and algorithm, I try to find a better way to make the big models trained on big data really happen. 

## Brief Biography
I am pursuing my the PhD. degree in [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology under the supervision of [Prof. Kai Chen](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~kaichen/). Before that, I have received my M.Phil. degree on Computer Software and Theory from [Institution of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.is.cas.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Yunquan Zhang](http://www.carch.ac.cn/yjdw/yjy/201906/t20190628_497178.html) and [Dr. Guoping Long](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0026886). My B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology is from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/).

## Research Interests
Co-design in both System and Algorithm especially for:
- **Efficient big model training on big data**
- **Efficient model inference for real-time requirements**
- **Real big data without perfect supervision** \
  e.g. semi-supervised, unsupervised, noisy, out-of-distribution and sparse reward

## Miscellaneous
- I am a badminton fan and amateur player, especially for the men's double game. I prefer combining drop shots with smashes to win a game. I usually use a even-balance and long-size [Duora](https://www.yonex.com/duora-z-strike-duo-zs) racket from Yonex to better control the ball.
- If have time, I also like reading, hiking and watching football to refresh and relax myself.
